Top 10 model features by importance:
1. humidity: 0.1668
2. ambient_temp: 0.1564
3. time_since_cooking: 0.1269
4. storage_time: 0.1231

Interpretation:
Features with higher importance (shown above) are the ones the RandomForest uses most when
deciding between Fresh/Medium/Spoiled. Expect environmental factors (ambient_temp, humidity),
time-related factors (time_since_cooking, storage_time), and strong categorical indicators
(e.g., storage_condition=refrigerated, smell descriptors or wet moisture) to dominate.

Suggestions:
- If temperature/humidity features are top-ranked, consider improving measurement precision
- If categorical placeholders dominate, consider richer numeric interactions (temp*humidity)
