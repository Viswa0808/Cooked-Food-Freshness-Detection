# Cooked-Food-Freshness-Detection
This is a fully offline, beginner-friendly local project that: - synthesizes Indian-region food-storage data (temperature &amp; humidity variations), - trains a scikit-learn model to predict cooked-food freshness (Fresh / Medium / Spoiled), - provides a simple Tkinter GUI to enter sample features and get predictions.
